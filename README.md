# Options Pricing Engine

A C++ implementation of quantitative finance models for options pricing, developed as part of my preparation for quantitative trading roles.

## Project Goals

- Implement Black-Scholes model for European options
- Add Greeks calculations (Delta, Gamma, Theta, Vega, Rho)
- Build Monte Carlo simulation for American options
- Develop command-line interface for analysis

## Status

**In Development** - Project started November 2024

Currently implementing core Black-Scholes functionality.

## Motivation

As a first-year student preparing for quantitative finance roles, I'm building this project to:
- Deepen understanding of derivative pricing theory
- Strengthen C++ programming skills
- Bridge theoretical coursework with practical applications
